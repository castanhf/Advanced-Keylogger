# Advanced-Keylogger
Developed a fully functional keylogger during my free time, with the help of Udemy.
The keylogger records all the input from the keyboard and mouse, and stores it into logfiles.
The program has mail sending capabilities and it encrypts the logfiles.
There is another program implemented that decrypts those logfiles on the creatorâ€™s end.

From Creator69:
"Please do not use this code for illegal or immoral purpose and keep it open source!

To compile it you need to enable C++11 standards and -mwindows flag

The Keylogger is able to capture all the keystrokes using system hooks.
In addition to this, it is also able to put them into a file, encrypt the file and send the file via mail based on a timer."
